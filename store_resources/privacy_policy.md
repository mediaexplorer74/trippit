# Trippit Privacy Policy
Trippit has the capability to collect anonymous usage information through the usage of Microsoft's HockeyApp. By default, this telemetry is disabled, but the user can choose to enable it via a toggle under the app's settings.

No information transmitted is personally identifiable, or disclosed to any third parties beyond those necessary to facilitate data transfer between the app and the HockeyApp service.
